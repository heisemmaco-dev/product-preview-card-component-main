## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

i learned a lot from this project, this is my first html and css work that i have used the media quiries and this also my first time of hearing about this html tag that is called <source> and the attribute srcset, i find it really fund to use it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media (min-width="600px")
}

### Continued development

i will like to focus on how to use media queries more, learning more sentags of html and css property to make my work more effective
